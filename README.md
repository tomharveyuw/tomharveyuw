Hello,

I am a developer, ready to transition away from a legacy independent business selling Win32 software developed in an obscure language called Clarion, which I had inherited from an uncle. I am now looking to get into a modern (likely corporate) software development role.

I am highly adaptable and possess great communication skills, having dealt with all aspects of running a business for well over a decade.

Most recently, I have been working on an online booking platform based on a LAMP stack (low transaction volume).

Beyond PHP, HTML 5, CSS and MySQL, I've also been brushing up on things like Java, JavaScript, C# and more - all of which I have used in various (fairly minor) capacities in the past as well. I've been exposed to and have worked with a vast array of technologies.

I have developed, for instance, a touch-screen friendly client program accessing a Windows background server service over TCP/IP via a custom XML web services style model, among other things (legacy full stack on a shoe string?) - but that code cannot easily be shown publicly. I've also worked on many conversions from various databases and data file types, but again I can't show that here. So, I've uploaded a few small interesting items I've worked on over the years which are more comfortably shared.

Thank you for visiting!

Tom
